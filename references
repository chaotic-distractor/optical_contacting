Effect of van der Waals forces on thermal conductance at the interface of a single-wall carbon nanotube array and silicon (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4904099):
The conclusion that it improves thermal conductance may have relevance in regards to heating up the silicon plates for improved optical contacting. 

High accuracy measurement of the residual air gap thickness of thin-film and solid-spaced filters assembled by optical contacting (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2005.10.015):
This describes a potential way to assess the quality of a bond. It also raises a good point about the longevity of the bonds.

Van der Waals:
Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physcists by V. Adrian Parsegian
I did not get the chance to read this carefully, but this looks valuable for any general questions on the concept.

Optical contact and van der Waals interactions: the role of the surface topography in determining the bonding strength of thick glass plates (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1464-4258/3/1/314/meta):
This does a good job of introducing and explained the (speculated) forces behind optical contacting. Specifically, it explains van der Waals forces and their relevance to bonding two surfaces. Thereâ€™s quite a few valuable references as well.
