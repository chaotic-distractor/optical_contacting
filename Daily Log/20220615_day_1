Reinforced direct bonding of optical materials by femtosecond laser welding
https://opg.optica.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-51-12-2098&id=232005
This discusses how laser welding improves the shear strength of direct bonds. I read it in order to see how they measured shear strength, but now I am wondering why we are not using laser welding for this project's application. They also mention mention using optical transmission % to asses bond quality.
