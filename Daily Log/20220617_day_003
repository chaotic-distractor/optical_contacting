I need to get a parts list into Rana and Koji ASAP.
I THINK I have the shear strength figured out. My biggest concern is the wafer mount, but I'm sure they can help troubleshoot that. I know the OoM of the pieces, so I could probably order some cheaper 10x10x1mm blocks to test fit the mount.
As for the index of refraction, I realized that my approach would (probably) not work. It could give a realtive measurement, but the difference in distance between the bonded layers would be so minute that I probably could not measure it nor could I extract the index of refraction or thickness from it.

I read this yesterday, but forgot to log it. I needed help trying to figure out the index of refraction stuff, and they measured that in this experiment, but I had trouble understanding what they did.
