Summary of work accomplished:
-----------------------------
Read some papers.
Cannot figure out how to test shear strength.

Full log:
-----------
1400
I read (1) to learn about how they measured shear strength and from is discovered (2).
1500
I decided to look for some more papers about finding the shear strength. In (3), I learned of a device that is designed for measuring shear strength. If there happens to be a lab on campus with it, it may be nice to use, since it would likely be more precise than anything I could jerry rig.
Then I found (4), where I learned about die-shear testing, which is for semiconductors, but I think the same principles apply for my optical contacting. The afformentioned device is one such device designed for die-shear testing. I ctrl-f-ed a few more papers that came up when I searched "shear strength direct bonding silicon" and they used the same device/technique. There has to be at least one of these devices on campus, although I don't know the minutiae of how you'd go about finding and gaining access to it.
1600
I started roughly planning out how to jerry rig a way to measure shear strength based on (1).
1700
I am having trouble with the shear strength jerry rig. I can't figure out how to make it accurate, precise, and feesible to build. I would much prefer if I could just use the die-strength testing device.
I'm going to move on to the light refraction stuff instead.
1800
Went on dinner break but not before buying some IR LED transmitter and reciever diodes (they came as a pack) on Amazon. Might not be precise enough, but could be used for laser (more details on paper).

Random notes:
-------------
Optical contacting = direct bonding = (historically?) contact bonding
Should I bring up die shear test? Is it relevant? It would require adherring a smaller piece to a bigger piece, like a circuitboard.

Papers:
-------
(1) (READ) Reinforced direct bonding of optical materials by femtosecond laser welding
https://opg.optica.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-51-12-2098&id=232005
This discusses how laser welding improves the shear strength of direct bonds. I read it in order to see how they measured shear strength, but now I am wondering why we are not using laser welding for this project's application. They also mention mention using optical transmission % to asses bond quality.

(2) (NEED TO READ) Contact bonding, including direct-bonding in a historical and recent context of materials science and technology, physics and chemistry: Historical review in a broader scope and comparative outlook
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927796X02000037?via%3Dihub
(It looks really interesting from a historical perspective, but it's too long to read today.

(3) (SKIMMED) Low-temperature direct bonding of diamond (100) substrate on Si wafer under atmospheric conditions
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359646220305959
https://www.nordson.com/en/divisions/dage/products/bondtesters/4000plus-bondtester
Mentions a device (4000plus, Nordson DAGE) specifically designed for measuring shear strength (and other bond qualities).

(4) (SKIMMED) Low-Temperature Bonding of Laser Diode Chips on Silicon Substrates Using Plasma Activation of Au Films
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4390061
Mentions die-shear strength, which led me to learn about die-shear testing.
