Today I need to figure out if 1) my designs for shear strength and index of refraction are viable 2) figure out the specifications of what I need to order if 
2000
I lost track of time and forgot to provide updates. I've been working on trying to figure out how to handle the index of refraction stuff.

Random notes:

Since finding the mechanical q seemed like the biggest undertaking from a conceptual prespective, I started with finding shear strengtha and index of refraction, but I've hit road blocks with both of them. I have an experiment design and I have a parts list for said design, but I'm not sure how viable that design will be in practice.


NEVER MIND IT WOULD BE TOO SMALL (WE'RE TALKING NANO AND PICO METERS)
Email draft:
Do you know if it would be possible for me to get access to a bond testing machine? They are usually used for testing the die shear strength of pieces on a circuitboard, but several papers used them for testing the shear strength of direct bonds. The particular machine they used was a Nordson Bondtester, but anything that is capable of performing a die shear test would work. I'm not suggesting we buy one (they're several thousand dollars), but I imagine there has to be at least one already on campus.
I've come up with a way to test the shear strength without the machine, but I imagine a machine specifically designed for testing shear strength would be far more precise and accurate than anything I could build.
