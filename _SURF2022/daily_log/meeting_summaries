Here is a link to the microscope slides:

I got to see the Electronics shop and the hotplate. I don't have a key to get in there, but I've requested one, which I should get by Monday.

Here is a summary of our meeting, per your request last time we met.

We discussed what physically is the index of refraction.

We both agreed that my design for finding shear strength is reasonable, but you pointed out that, while it works in theory, mounting a small, fragile object is difficult, so I should think some more about how to go about that.

You told me to send you a link to order microscope slides (see above) since it is easier to practice with them than silicon.

We discussed the actual procress of optical contacting, including how things should be layered on top of the hot plate and how to measure the temperature. The layers are hot plate --> "soft" object (hard plastic, gold foil, etc.) --> temperature measure --> the two wafers --> another temperature measure --> heavy weight. Measuring the temperature will probably involve copper foil (which can also serve as the "soft" object), a thermocoupler, and the Fluke brand hand temperature measurer or hand-held multimeter. For the latter, I'll measure resistance and get temperature from that using a RTD. We also talked about the different step-by-step ways to prep the pieces before bonding, and you suggested I look at a paper "Solution-Assisted Optical Contacting" by Shaddock.

Finally, the big question we need to figure out in the next few weeks is: "What is good enough?" for the bond.
