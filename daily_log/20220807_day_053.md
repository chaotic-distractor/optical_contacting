# Day 053 - 08/07/2022

To do on Monday* so I don't forget:
- Arduino
  - (I have confirmed that I can turn AC on/off)
  - test this with the hot plate
  - start trying to figure out how to map on/off cycles to temperature
    - review that video of it setting each temperature
    - once the hot plate starts heating up, it takes a while to cool off
    - so to reach [x] temp, you esentially want it on for [x] seconds/minutes then off for a long time with the occasional quick flip on
    - how does the hot plate decide when to turn on and off? if it's a temperature sensor, that might be a problem
    - I need to keep it from turning off becuase it's "programing" tells it to
- heating + pressure
  - I can start with heating + pressure even without the precise control 
  - this just means attaching the thermocouples
  - I still haven't figured out if the tests I did with pressure and w/out heating made a difference
  - is there some way to get a digital recording from the Fluke multimeter bc it would be cool to do some fancy coding to control the temp if I could
- testing the bond strength
  - razor blade
    - see if I can perform it with the materials provided
    - if I can, then I can test the heated slides
  - suspension
    - I need to draft a design for this and get a list of materials
- SURF reports/final presentation
  - don't forget to revise the first report
  - don't let this creep up on you
- other (not related to SURF)
  - finish SoP meeting prep (meeting at 10am on Wed)
    - this includes actually looking at the programs for the grad school you're interested in!
  - take phGRE practice exam and decide if you want to sign up (I think you have until the 12th? assuming I can get a spot) 

*I don't expect to get this all done on Monday, but you get the idea
