When the slides succesfully bond, I call them the "sample" instead of slides to avoid confusion with the plural in slides.


Yesterday:

Tried cleaning the slides with Kimwipes to see if that was enough to get them to stick. They'd stick for about half a second when you lifted them up, before falling apart. It was very easily to slide them apart. I watched some videos on it, but it wasn't clear what the magic trick to getting it to work is.

I accidentally achived my first good bond by clasping two wet slides together. I repreated this by running the slides under the tap while pushing them together. I came back after dinner to check on the slides, and found that it was pretty difficult to pry the second one apart. Not impossibly hard, but it took a bit of prying with my fingers to get it to budge a few millimeters. After I slid it apart, I slid it back into place.

I left four slides overnight: 1 that was just two cleaned slides on top of eachother. Another than was the same as the first, but with the brass weight on top of it. Finally I had the two water-bonded slides.


Today:

I checked how the overnight slides had fared. The two air ones came apart no more difficult than before. My first water-bonded sample seemed weaker. I pivot the slides around this one point that refused to break. I took video of myself violently shaking it, during which it came apart. The second water-bonded sample seemed stronger than the last time I checked it. My thumbs alone could not push it apart. I had to really try at multiple angles to finally get them to budge a millimeter. I tried prying them apart with a box cutter, but the blade couldn't get between them. I tired doing this both in my hands and with the sample secured in a clamp. Then I tried this razor that was stuck to a mangaet on a filing cabinet and the slides came apart instantly with no resitance.

I water-bonded a sample then stuck in on the hot plate on Medium for maybe 15-30 minutes just to see what happened. When I took them off, the bond was gone (this was in fact foreshadowing). In the meantime, I grabed some isopropanol and methanol in the EE shop and started experimenting with that. Just rubbing a little bit isopropanol on the slides then sticking them together did nothing. I then tried squirting enough on that it completely filled the gap when I put the other slide on it (for here on out, assume this is what I mean when I say "I used [water/isopropanol/methanol]). After letting it set for a bit, I tried prying it apart. It made a bond comparable to water. I found that if I slid it slightly then slid it back into place,
