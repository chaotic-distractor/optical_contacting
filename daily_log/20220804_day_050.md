# Day 050 - 08/04/2022

Excluding the strength tests, there's two things I need to work on:
- attaching the thermocouples and whatnot so I can start doing the pressure + heat tests
- setting up the Arduino to control the temperature (I won't waste more than an afternoon trying to get it to work)

I also need to get the balance from the 40m lab, and I need to clean up my workplace so I can put down the aluminum foil. During the heating process, since the only thing I need to do is sit in the room in case it combusts, I'll save working on the strength test stuff for then.
