1. Shear strength 
2. Index of refraction
3. Mechanical q 

----------------------------------
Things I want to accomplish today:
----------------------------------
â–¢ model the shear strength apparatus
  â–¢ need to design
    â–¢ beam balance
    â–¢ thing to attach weights to
    â–¢ sample mount
    â–¢ a way of hooking the sample mount to the table
  ðŸ—¸ maybe try making part of the sample mount for 3D printing
    â–¢ how will I protect the fragile samples?
â–¢ see if I can find that page that explained van der waals forces
â–¢ draw out diagram for index of refraction
â–¢ work on code for mech Q
â–¢ start writing interim report
â–¢ maybe clean up git repo a little more

-----------------------------
Summary of work accomplished:
-----------------------------
Bought some microscope slides on Amazon Prime: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JEJBG64/
They'll be used to practice optical contacting and for testing my sample mount design(s)
Designed the 3D component of the shear strength aparatus, which took a while because I also learned how to use Tinkercad, made an appointment to get trained on the 3D printers, and had to install/figure out the 3D printing software.

I was hoping this might help with estimating shear strength
