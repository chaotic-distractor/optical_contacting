Day 042 - 07/27/2022

At long last, after being waylaid by food poisoning and the LIGO, I have remembered again to make a daily log.

Things that need to get done:

- pick final presentation slot
- get silicon wafers
- write interim report #2 and abstract
- figure out why

Two big discoveries!

1) I can achive a sufficient (as in, it won't immediately fall apart) bond just by rubbing the two slides against eachover.
2) It's not the liquid that's causing the bond to break. When I put the dry, hand-bonded slides on the heat, they almost immediately broke.

I think I'll write up my bonding proceedure(s) next as well as try to translate the ones described in various papers for an appendix.
