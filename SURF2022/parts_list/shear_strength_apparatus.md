# Shear Strength Aparatus

I have broken down the aparatus into sections:

![overview](https://github.com/jhritzCaltech/SURF2022/blob/main/parts_list/shear_strength_graphics/shear_strength_overview.png?raw=true)



Circle = joint

Red = Base

Orange = Bottom arm

Yellow = Mount

Green = Left/right arm

Blue = Central arm

Violet = Central shaft

Purple = Weight hanger

## Base
A heavy and stable piece of metal (or something equivalent to keep the experiment grounded).

## Bottom arm
This keeps the mount attached to the table as the sample is pulled upwards.

## Mount
The idea is that sample will be put in a 3D printed plastic buffer and then inserted in a metal casing, which is attatched to the rest of the appratus. I am hoping that the plastic will protect the fragile sample from damage.

Here is my rough design on how it would look.

![f3](https://github.com/jhritzCaltech/SURF2022/blob/main/parts_list/shear_strength_graphics/shear_design_f3.jpg?raw=true)

As shown below, I would need straight and elbow pieces of metal, bolts (regular and hooked), nuts (regular and winged), and something to screw holes in the metal.

![f4](https://github.com/jhritzCaltech/SURF2022/blob/main/parts_list/shear_strength_graphics/shear_design_f4.jpg?raw=true)

## Left/right arm

I would need some sort of tube or rod with a holes in it. As well as more bolts, nuts, and hooks.

I could also attempt to mimic the paper's design, but it requires cutting notches in metal, which looks difficult compared to screwing holes.

## Central arm

To pivot on the axis, it would need a smooth rod stuck through a hole drilled through it.

## Central shaft

Just a straight piece of metal capable of bearing weight.

## Weight hanger

I am not entirely sure how to engineer something from scratch that is capable of holding ~100 kg. The referenced paper used a slotted weight set. Hopefully we can use one of those, or at least use the weight hanger that comes with them. Otherwise, I would probably need to weld a thick circular baseplate to a sturdy rod.
