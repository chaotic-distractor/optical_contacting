Van der waals forces are made up of:
Keesom interactions = dipolâ€“dipol interactions of molecules that carry permanent dipoles
Debye interactions = forces between a permanent dipole that induces a dipole moment in an otherwise unpolar molecule
London interactions (or dispersion interactions) = forces between instantaneously induced dipoles

pairwise additivity =

Hamaker constant
