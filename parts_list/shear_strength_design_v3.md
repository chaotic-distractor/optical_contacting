# New shear strength design

Since my previous designes were infeasible, I tried to come up with a new, simpler apparatus. I was working on my interim report when this design suddenly came to mind.



It works as such:

1) Bond the glass slides to create the sample.

2) Secure the bottom half of the sample with a vice grip.

There is a concern that securing the sample will break it, so I would propose putting some plastic between the glass and the metal, perhaps something that is 3D printed.

3) Set up a push force meter to measure the force against the side of the top half of the sample.

I haven't seen any push meters in the EE shop, but I also haven't looked that hard. I'll look in other labs as well, or we could just order one.

4) Push against the side of the top half of the sample until it slips, meanwhile recording the force at which it slips.

I don't know what I would use to push against the sample. Maybe something that I could slowly crank like the vice. I have to imagine there's something in one of the labs that can accomplish this.
