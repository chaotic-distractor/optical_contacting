For now,this is just the list of parts. Further details can be found elsewhere (once I get Overleaf properly syncing to this repository).

---------------
Direct bonding:
---------------
1. WIP
2.

---------------
Shear strength:
---------------
1. Traditional beam balance
  a. Made of???
  b.
2. Various weights
  a.
3. Lab jack
  a.
4. Mount for bonded wafers
  a.
5. Wafers
  a. OOM 10mm x 10mm x 1mm

--------------------
Index of refraction:
--------------------
1. Laser source
  a. 1550 nm
  b. Could be replaced with IR LED
2. Linear polarizer
3. Compensator (x2?) (optional?)
4. Wafers
  a. Probably same OOM as the ones for shear strenght
  b. (But I have yet to back this up mathematically)
5. Detector

Mechanical Q:
-------------
1. Tuning fork
  a. 3 wafers of TBD dimensions
2. Vacuum chamber
  a. Should have some way to measure internal pressure
3. Turbomolecular pump
  a. For evacuating vacuum chamber
4. Liquid nitrogen
  a. For cooling vacuum chamber
5. 2 x Teflon gaskets - OR some other way to clamp the tuning fork
  a. One needs to be spring loaded
  b. Note that it needs to be attached at a vibration node
6.
