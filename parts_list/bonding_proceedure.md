## Heating process

I will need:

1) Hot plate
2) 2* x Copper foil
3) 2* x thermocouplers
4) 2* x thing for measuring the thermocouplers
5) (Optional) 2 x hard, plastic rectangles
6) Heavy, flat, rectangular pice of metal

*I will need 3 is if I want to measure the temperature between the samples as well.

#### Hotplate

The hotplate is made by [Oster](https://www.amazon.com/Oster-CKSTSB100-B-2NP-Adjustable-Temperature-Control/dp/B0082JMCB6). An Amazon customers reports that it can only reach about 100Â°C. It's 112 mm by 267 mm by 282 mm. My hand is about as long as the plate, which means it's about 150 mm.

#### Copper foil

This will both act a soft buffer between the samples as well as a way to transmit the temperature. It will need to be slightly bigger than the sample so the thermocouple can be attatched to it.

#### Thermocouplers

I am still a bit confused about these. My understanding is: if I attach the thermocoupler to the copper foil (via solder or copper tape), the heat will flow from the foil to it, and then I will get a temperature reading. I think that means I need an exposed thermocoupler, compared to the insulated/grounded ones, which cannot be attatched to the foil?

I looked in the Electronics shop to see if I could find any thermocouplers, but there were none there. I also could not find one of the devices that the thermocouples should be hooked to.

**If I cannot get thermocouplers***, I will instead measure the resistance of the foil while it's heating and determine the temperature from that.

#### (Optional) Hard, plastic rectangles

Just an extra "soft" buffer between the samples and hot plate/weight. In the diagram, they'd go below the bottom copper foil and above the top copper foil.

#### "Thing for measuring thermocouplers"

I was told I would find a "Fluke brand hand temperature measurer (or hand-held multimeter)" in the Electronics shop, but I could not find them after a brief search. If I do not use thermocouplers, then a regular multimeter will suffice.

#### Heavy, flat, rectangular pice of metal

This is the best weight, in my opinion, since the weight is distributed evenly. I have yet to determine how much the piece of metal should weigh.
