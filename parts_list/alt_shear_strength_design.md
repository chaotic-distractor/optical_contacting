# Alternative Shear Strength Design

Inspired by pg. 192 of [Properties of bonded silicon for future generations of gravitational wave observatories](https://theses.gla.ac.uk/41177/)

![alt design mock up](https://github.com/jhritzCaltech/SURF2022/blob/main/parts_list/shear_strength_graphics/shear_strength_alt_mock_up.jpg?raw=true)

The red/purple/blue rectangles is the bonded sample, where the interface between red/purple and purple/blue are direct bonds. The entire thing is suspended by the cylinders. Weight is added to the purple rectangle while the blue and red are held securely by the solid and transparent grey rectangles. Weight will be added until failure.

The limitations of this design are:
1) we want to test the shear strength of something thin, not a large rectangle
2) adding weight to the central piece may be difficult
3) we're relying on two, not one, bonds, which adds less precision
4) there's still a challenge with securing the sample in a way that does not break them
5) it also still requires some effort to build, although theres far less components
