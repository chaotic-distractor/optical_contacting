# What is optical contacting?
Optical contacting is "the bonding of very flat, highly polished surfaces without the use of adhesives," typically between silica surfaces. In theory, Van der Waals dispersion forces between atoms and molecules are largely responsible for the adhesion. However, practically, there are a lot of factors to consider relating to contamination, roughness, and deviation from flatness. [1] Normally, such intermolecular forces would be too weak to hold the surfaces together, but when the surface is sufficiently smooth, the molecules are close enough together for those forces to bond the surfaces. If the surfaces are too rough or too dirty, the bold will not be sufficiently. [2] Optical contacting is desirable over adhesives because once the two surfaces are joined, their adhesion can only be broken by thermal stress. [3]

# What is the applications of optical contacting?
This is very useful for space-based optical systems because... [4]  

# How is optical contacting achieved in the labratory?
First, the surfaces must obviously be polished. Surface roughness is given as Î»/X RMS, which is the root mean square of a surfaces micrscopic peaks and valleys. The higher the X, the smoother the surface. The various papers had different measures as to what a good X value is. [3] and [4] used 8. [1] was requested to get over 20, and they managed to achieve 40.
The general idea is to
1) 

"All of the contacting was performed in a relatively dusty laboratory. A number of successful contacts were achieved where up to two or three visible pieces of dust could be seen. These were clearly visible due to refraction patterns between the optic and bench. On a number of optics, the final step of dropping isopropyl between the surfaces was repeated until a successful contact was achieved." [1]

# Methods to improve contact
Heating or annealing the surfaces can improve contact strength.
