## What is optical contacting?
# Optical contacting is "the bonding of very flat, highly polished surfaces without the use of adhesives," typically between silica surfaces. In theory, Van der Waals dispersion forces between atoms and molecules are largely repsonsible for the adhesion. However, practically, there are a lot of factors to consider relating to contamination, roughness, and deviation from flatness. [1] Normally, such intermolecular forces would be too weak to hold the surfaces together, but when the surface is suffiently smooth, the molecules are close enough together for those forces to bond the surfaces. If the surfaces are too rough or too 

## How is optical contacting achieved in the labratory?
# "All of the contacting was performed in a relatively dusty laboratory. A number of successful contacts were achieved where up to two or three visible pieces of dust could be seen. These were clearly visible due to refraction patterns between the optic and bench. On a number of optics, the final step of dropping isopropyl between the surfaces was repeated until a successful contact was achieved." [1]
