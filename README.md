# What is optical contacting?
Optical contacting is "the bonding of very flat, highly polished surfaces without the use of adhesives," typically between silica surfaces. In theory, Van der Waals dispersion forces between atoms and molecules are largely responsible for the adhesion. However, practically, there are a lot of factors to consider relating to contamination, roughness, and deviation from flatness. [1] Normally, such intermolecular forces would be too weak to hold the surfaces together, but when the surface is sufficiently smooth, the molecules are close enough together for those forces to bond the surfaces. If the surfaces are too rough or too dirty, the bold will not be sufficiently. [2] Optical contacting is desirable over adhesives because once the two surfaces are joined, their adhesion can only be broken by thermal stress. [3]

# What is the applications of optical contacting?
Optical contacting is desirable over adhesives because once the two surfaces are joined, their adhesion can only be broken by thermal stress. There is also no issue undesirable thermal or chemical interactions of the adhesives. [3] This is very useful for space-based optical systems. In particular, using SiC to bond the surfaces is an ideal choice because “it has outstanding thermal conductivity, a high Young’s modulus, and is relatively lightweight.” [4] 

# How is the success/strength of the bond measured?
[see NASA paper about how they tested it. they also mentioned how to measure smoothness?]

The flow of heat is also a good measure of effective contact area because the larger the contact area, the more efficiently the heat will flow. This can be done experimentally by measuring the temperature gradient across a sample while heating one side with a heating element of known power.

# How is optical contacting achieved in the labratory?
First, the surfaces must obviously be polished. Surface roughness is given as λ/X RMS, which is the root mean square of a surfaces micrscopic peaks and valleys. The higher the X, the smoother the surface. The various papers had different measures as to what a good X value is. [3] and [4] used 8. [1] was requested to get over 20, and they managed to achieve 40.

The process of pushing two surfaces together to connect them through molecular bonds is known as "ansprengen." [2][4] The general idea for the procedure is:

1) Polish the surfaces

2) Clean the surfaces

3) Place the surfaces together

4) (Optional) Apply heat, pressure, etc.

5) Achieve a bond between the surfaces

The smoothness and cleanliness will both be tested during the procedure. In one case, isopropyl was repeatedly dropped between the surfaces until contact was achieved. [1]

# Methods to improve contact
Heating or annealing the surfaces have been shown to improve contact strength. However, further research needs to be done to explore how to optimize. [4]
